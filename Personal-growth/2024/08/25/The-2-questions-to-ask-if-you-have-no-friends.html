    <p>I was fourteen and I was crying. It was the most significant event in my life. But I didn’t know that then. I was crying, because of one simple truth. I had no friends. Nobody liked me. Even my dad told me that he likes my sister more than me. And that’s when two questions occurred to me. Two questions that completely changed my mind.</p>

<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>

<p>First I asked myself: <em>What are the nice things about me? What could people like?</em> The answer was simple. I was kind. I was supportive. I knew how to apologize. So I didn’t understand why I had no friends. This is where the second question was very helpful.</p>

<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>

<p><em>For each of these traits, what is the evidence for and against it?</em> Unsurprisingly, the evidence was clear. I was bullshitting myself. I wasn’t kind, supportive or pretty much anything else nice. I was being a dick to people. That’s why I didn’t have friends.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>

<p>If you already think you are a horrible person, that there is nothing good about you and no one can like you, I don’t think that this exercise is going to help you. Just forget about it. This is helpful to people like me who treat others terribly without realising it. (Also, typically people who think they are a terrible nuisance aren’t so terrible. And people who think are great aren’t so great)</p>

<h3 id="why-ask-those-questions">Why ask those questions?</h3>

<p>There can be many explanations for not having friends. If the explanation is that you are a dick, you are in luck. It’s the best reason you could hope for. Why? Cause it’s completely under your control. Of course, it can feel shitty admitting that to yourself. But it’s amazing because you can change it. You can have friends and your life can suck less.</p>

<p>Not having friends because you are a dick is a much better situation than not having friends because everyone around you is a dick.</p>

<p>So I’d ask those questions to hopefully find out that this is the reason for not having a friend.</p>

<h3 id="when-you-find-out-you-are-a-dick">When you find out you are a dick</h3>

<p><strong>Rejoice</strong>. It means this situation is totally under your control and it can be much better.</p>

<p><strong>Have realistic expectations</strong>. Even if you do your best it will take a lot of time before people will start perceiving you differently. The good things will be exceptions and the slip-ups will be the “typical you”.</p>

<p><strong>Have a good mindset.</strong> For me, that meant repeating this: If I try my best now, I still won’t have any friends tomorrow. But there is no other choice than to try now because if I want to have friends in a year, I need to try today.</p>

<p>This is my very first post here, would love to hear feedback from you:)</p>
